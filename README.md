### Javascript Moba Game
######  

This is another example of using the canvas framework [KineticJs](http://kineticjs.com/) that I created with my friend [Robert Hickman](http://students.cs.byu.edu/~hickmanr/#!). It is based off the Starcraft 2 arcade game [Nexus wars](http://www.starcraftarcade.com/nexus-wars/overview/) and an extension of my [sandman project](http://yuccaberry.net/project/sandman/). 

It uses the same pathing algorithm to seek enemy units with some simple AI added in for a computer player.
If no enemy is found it will travel to the opposite side of the board. It is still a work in project with my idea to eventually turn it into a full fledged [MOBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena).
About 500 units can be created and search for enemies before the game starts to slow down.

### How to Play
######  

Click on the menu bar below the game to place a building. Your units will automatically seek out enemy units. 

Each unit has different stats: 

* Warrior has a lot of life but is melee
* Archer is fast and can fire fast
* Mage has a long range and hits hard but has low life
